## Stage Tracker Lite (formerly CurrentStageMod)
#### By SlouchingCat (April 2018)

### Mod Features:
This mod helps players keep track of their progress by tracking the current stage number.
Each stage, the counter will advance and send a message to the chat that can be viewed by pressing ENTER.
On Intermission stages (Bazaar and Moment), the counter will not advance. A message will still be posted on which stage will be next.

#### Future Features:
- Global announcement for multiplayer
- UI overlay with stage number
- Toggle this mod's features on/off

#### Usage:
This mod is intended to be used with **BepInEx**.

Copy the `StageTrackerLite` .dll into the `BepInEx\plugins` directory.

Note: In future versions this mod plans to switch to multimod for better UI support.

#### Patch Notes:
- v1.1.2: Fixed an issue with stage count not resetting when starting a new run.
- v1.1.1: Core functionality added.
