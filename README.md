###Mod Features:
This mod helps players keep track of their progress by tracking the current stage number.

On Intermission stages (Bazaar and Moment), the counter will not advance. A message will still be posted on which stage will be next.

#### Future Features:
- Global announcement for multiplayer
- UI overlay with stage number
- Toggle this mod's features on/off in-game

#### Usage:
This mod is intended to be used with **BepInEx**.

Copy the `CurrentStageMod` folder (containing the .dll) into the `BepInEx\plugins` directory.
